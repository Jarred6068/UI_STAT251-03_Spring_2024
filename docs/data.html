<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>This project is worth 25 points, and it will be due in Canvas on
<strong>December 10th at midnight</strong>. The objective of this
project is to engage you in a hands-on exploration of statistical
analysis. In this project you will demonstrate your understanding of the
main tenets of statistical description and inference that we have
learned in this class. You will start by selecting and investigating two
variables from one of three provided datasets: Dataset A, Dataset B, or
Dataset C. A detailed description of each dataset is given below</p>

<li><p><strong>Low (qualitative)</strong> - indicator of birth weight
less than 2.5 kg. (1 = less than 2.5 kg, 0 = greater than 2.5
kg)</p></li>

years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lwt (quantitative)</strong> - mother’s weight in pounds
at last menstrual period.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Race (qualitative)</strong> - mother’s race (1 = white, 2

<li><p><strong>Ptl (quantitative)</strong> - number of previous
premature labours.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ht (qualitative)</strong> – indicator of history of
hypertension. (1 = history of hypertension, 0 = no history of
hypertension)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ui (qualitative)</strong> – indicator of presence of
uterine irritability. (1 = presence of uterine irritability, 0 = no
presence of uterine irritability)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ftv (quantitative)</strong> - number of physician visits
during the first trimester.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bwt (quantitative)</strong> birth weight in
