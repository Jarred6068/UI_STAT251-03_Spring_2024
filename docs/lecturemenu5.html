<div id="density-curves" class="section level3">
<h3>Density Curves</h3>
<p>We have discussed previously that a histogram is a good tool for
visualizing a distribution for most variables. Nevertheless, it is
crucial to recognize that the bars in a histogram depict discrete
frequencies corresponding to distinct values, or in the case of
continuous variables, to discrete intervals. In contrast, the true
nature of a continuous variable involves a distribution function that is
inherently continuous. Consequently, this distribution is more
accurately represented by a smooth curve rather than discrete bars. We
call such a curve a <strong>density curve</strong> and the
<i>density</i> component can be interpreted as a continuous measure of
“how often” a value occurs. We will talk more about the nature of
density later when we discuss probability. For now, it is useful to know
that a density curve is how we represent the distribution of a
continuous variable in theory. The plot below gives a visual example of
the difference between a density curve and a histogram for a continuous
random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span></p>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="576" /></p>
</div>
<div id="the-normal-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3>The normal distribution</h3>
<p>The density curve in the plot above is called a <i>normal curve</i>
and represents a family of distributions called <strong>normal
distributions</strong>. All normal distributions have the same general
shape - a symmetric bell-shape curve. The mean is located where the peak
is tallest. It also forms an axis of symmetry where both the left and
right portions of the distribution are mirror images.</p>
<p>The normal distribution has two parameters that govern its shape:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> determines
where the center of the distribution is located on the real number
line.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard deviation <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> governs its shape by how spread
out the values are.</p></li>
<li><p>We typically use the short hand notation <span
class="math inline">\(x_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\)</span> to denote that an
observation <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is normally
distributed with population mean <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and population standard deviation
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The diagram below shows how <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> relates to the shape of a normal
distribution</p>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<ul>
<li>A normal distribution with small <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> will be tall and skinny with a
sharp peak. A normal distribution with a large <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> will be short with a broad rounded
peak, like a hill.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>From the plot above, we can see that two distributions with the
same <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> will have the same
general shape, but if they have different <span
class="math inline">\(\\mu\)</span> the location of the center will be
different. Thus changing the value of the mean <span
class="math inline">\(\\mu\)</span> will shift the position of the
distribution on the real number line.</p></li>
<li><p>The cumulative density curve for a normal distribution forms a
shape like the letter S called a <i>sigmoid</i> curve. See the plot
below</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>
and the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> completely
determine the shape of a normal distribution. As a result, the standard
deviation is a natural measure of spread for normal-shaped distributions
and we can approximate its value by eye. Take for example the density
curve for a normal distribution with parameters <span
class="math inline">\(\mu = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>One standard deviation from the mean will always be the point on the
curve where the slope transitions from increasingly steep to
increasingly gradual. The red dot is plotted above the point at one
standard deviation from the mean and indicates the position of this
slope transition.</p>
<p>The density curve of a normal distribution at any point <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is given by the function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f(x) =
\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>We will not make direct use of this function in this class however,
this function represents a key point in the mathematical work in
probability and statistics regarding variables that exhibit
<i>normality</i></p>
<p>Why is the normal distribution important?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many real variables have normal distributions. For example, most
physical characteristics such as height, weight, length will have this
distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Normal distributions are often good approximations to many kinds
of chance outcomes such as counting the number of heads in many tosses
of a fair coin (more on this later).</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, and most importantly, many statistical inference
procedures that are based on normal distributions will still give good
results for other roughly symmetric distributions.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-empirical-rule" class="section level3">
<h3>The Empirical Rule</h3>
<p>Although there are many different normal curves, they all have common
properties. One of the most important is called the <i>empirical
rule</i> (also called the 68-95-99.7 rule). The <strong>empirical
rule</strong> states that for any approximately normal-shaped
distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and
standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>approximately <span class="math inline">\(68\%\)</span> of the
observations will have a value within 1 standard deviation of the
mean</p></li>
<li><p>approximately <span class="math inline">\(95\%\)</span> of the
observations will have a value within 2 standard deviations of the
mean</p></li>
<li><p>approximately <span class="math inline">\(99.7\%\)</span> of the
observations will have a value within 3 standard deviations of the
mean</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The plot below gives the empirical rule visualized on the cumulative
density</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>Consider the distribution of the height of female college athletes
from a survey of college students in the state of Georgia.</p>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Approximately, what proportion of the students will have a height
between 60 and 70 inches?</p></li>
<li><p>Approximately, what proportion of the students will have a height
<span class="math inline">\(\geq 70\)</span> inches?</p></li>
<li><p>Approximately, what proportion of the students will have a height
between 55 and 75 inches?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="standardizing-observations-the-z-score" class="section level3">
<h3>Standardizing Observations: The Z-score</h3>
<p>From the empirical rule, we know that nearly all of the observations
in a bell-shaped distribution will have a value within <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 3\sigma\)</span> of the mean. Therefore, we
can use the property of the empirical rule of normal distributions to
come up with a criteria for defining outliers that is specific to these
types of distributions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can define an outlier as an observation whose value is more
than <span class="math inline">\(3\sigma\)</span> greater than the mean
or <span class="math inline">\(3\sigma\)</span> less than the
mean.</p></li>
<li><p>More commonly, outliers are defined as an observation whose value
is more than <span class="math inline">\(\pm 2\sigma\)</span> from the
mean</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How can we easily tell how far an observation is from the mean?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, it is important to note that the value of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is affected by the units of the
variable. For example, in the distribution of college student heights
above, height is recorded in inches and the standard deviation of
college student height was about <span class="math inline">\(s =
5\)</span>. However if, we have the same dataset and height was recorded
in millimeters then the standard deviation would be much larger at <span
class="math inline">\(s = 127\)</span> because the units have smaller
increment. This makes comparing normal distributions, or determining
outliers dependent on the scale of the underlying variable.</p></li>
<li><p>To get around this, we can use something called a
<strong>z-score</strong>. A z-score is a standardization of an
observation from a normal distribution that can be directly interpreted
as the number of standard deviations the observation falls from the
mean. Mathematically a z-score is defined as</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[ z_i = \frac{\text{observation}
-\text{mean}}{\text{standard deviation}} =  \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s}
\]</span></p>
<p>by subtracting off the mean and dividing by the standard deviation,
we are performing a <i>linear transformation</i> to convert <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into a new unit scale. If the original
distribution of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is normal <span
class="math inline">\(x_i \sim N(\bar{x}, s)\)</span>, then computing
the z-score represents a rescaling of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s} \sim
N(\bar{x} - \bar{x}, s/s)\]</span></p>
<p>The distribution of <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> is a
special case of the normal distribution called the <strong>standard
normal distribution</strong>. The standard normal distribution has a
mean of zero and a standard deviation of one and we often define this in
symbols as <span class="math inline">\(z_i \sim N(0,1)\)</span></p>
<p>Lets consider the following example using data collected on the air
pollution of countries in the European Union:</p>

<p>The mean of C02 emissions is <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}
\approx 7.9\)</span> with a standard deviation of <span
class="math inline">\(s \approx 3.6\)</span>. Compute the <span
class="math inline">\(z-score\)</span> for the C02 air pollution of the
country Luxembourg. Is Luxembourg an outlier? If so, what does this mean
in terms of its C02 pollution?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The z-score for Luxembourg is computed as <span
class="math display">\[z = \frac{21.4 - 7.9}{3.6} =
3.75\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This indicates that the C02 emissions for the country Luxembourg
is 3.75 standard deviations above the mean C02 emissions in the EU.
Using the <span class="math inline">\(\pm 2s\)</span> rule for
determining outliers, we would conclude that the emissions for
Luxembourg are an outlier relative to the emissions for the rest of the
European Union. Thus by computing a z-score we can quickly discover how
extreme an observation is relative to its distribution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A note about <i> linear transformations </i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A linear or <i>affine</i> transformation of a variable DOES NOT
change the shape of its underlying distribution. Thus, converting <span
class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> does not “convert” the distribution
of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> into a normal distribution,
but instead, rescales the values <span
class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> to have zero center and unit
variance. If <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> comes from a
highly skewed distribution the transformed z-scores will also have a
skewed distribution. See plot below:</li>

<div id="sampling-distributions" class="section level3">
<h3>Sampling Distributions</h3>
<p>Consider a small study to estimate the average trunk diameter (in
feet) of Western Red Ceders at the idlers rest nature preserve just
outside of Moscow. The population distribution is given by the histogram
and dot plot below. The population consists of <span
class="math inline">\(N = 109\)</span> trees and the mean diameter is
<span class="math inline">\(\mu = 4.05\)</span> with standard deviation
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 1.81\)</span>. The green diamond
below denotes the value of the population mean diameter for trees at the
Idler’s Rest nature preserve.</p>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>Assume that we want to estimate the population mean trunk diameter
using a sample of <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> trees selected
at random from the nature preserve.</p>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>The 20 red dots in the plot above represent the trees we selected to
measure the diameter. From this sample of 20 trees, we estimate the mean
diameter to be <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_1 = 4.35\)</span>
feet. Now imagine we repeat this process and gather a new sample of
<span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> trees selected randomly from the
population.</p>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>The blue dots in the plot above constitute the trees selected for
measurement in the second sample. This time the sample mean is computed
as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_2 = 2.98\)</span> feet. Clearly,
our estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is dependent on
the sample we select. Now imagine that we repeat this process many times
- selecting a sample of 20 trees, measuring their diameters and
computing the sample mean. It’s easy to imagine that we would produce a
distribution of estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>.
Such a distribution is called a <strong>sampling distribution</strong>
and represents the distribution of a statistic. The sampling
distribution of for mean diameter from <span
class="math inline">\(10,000\)</span> samples of <span
class="math inline">\(n=20\)</span> trees is given below.</p>
<p><img src="lecturemenu5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>The variation in the sampling distribution of the mean shown above is
because of the differences between the samples. Again, the green dot
represents the population mean (<span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>). From the plot, you can observe that
the sampling distribution of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is centered at the true value of
the population parameter.</p>
<p>The <strong>margin of error</strong> of an estimate is how far we
expect an estimate to fall from the true value of a population
parameter. It defines a set of boundaries that allows us to quantify the
how much an estimate is expected to vary between samples. Formally, it
is the largest distance between the true population parameter and an
estimate that is <u>not an outlier</u>. Thus if we use the <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 2\sigma\)</span> rule to define outliers, the
margin of error of our estimate is the interval <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta} - 2\sigma &lt; \theta &lt;
\hat{\theta} + 2\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>In statistics, we often hear the words <i>significant</i> and <i>not
significant</i> when a particular statistical result is discussed. A
<strong>Statistically significant</strong> result is one that is
decidedly <i>not</i> due to ordinary variation - this means a result
that is not due to chance or coincidence. Thus, by convention, we
consider statistically significant results a result that falls outside
the <strong>margin of error</strong>.</p>

<div id="study-design" class="section level2">
<h2>Study Design</h2>
<p>We’ve covered basic data analysis tools, like graphs and numbers, to
describe individual variables and their distribution. Descriptive
statistics help us assess data suitability, identify outliers, and spot
patterns for further exploration. However, an exploratory analysis of a
set of data is rarely evidence enough to draw any major conclusions
about patterns we may observe. This is because patterns that emerge from
descriptive statistics can arise from many different sources.</p>
<div id="anecdotal-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Anecdotal Data</h3>
<p>It is often tempting to draw conclusions based on our personal
experiences or from second-hand accounts that are shared with us. An
example of anecdotal evidence might be a person claiming that a
particular herbal supplement cured their chronic headaches. Or A friend
may claim that a starvation diet is healthy because they knew a few
people who did it and they didn’t experience any major health effects.
However, <i>anecdotes</i> such as these are typically based on
haphazardly selected individual cases and do not provide a sound basis
for drawing conclusions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you think of a time where you or someone you know made a claim
based on anecdotal evidence?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="collecting-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Collecting Data</h3>
<p>Statistics is an incredibly important tool as it allows us to answer
questions in an objective way. The validity of our conclusions begins
with a careful approach to how we collect data. Because we live in a
digital world, data is typically readily available online. Most
governments around the world collect data and have national statistics
offices. The U.S has many government agencies that collect and host data
in the public domain including the National Agriculture Statistics
Service, The U.S Census Bureau, and the National Center for Education
Statistics - to name a few. Moreover, many companies now passively
collect data on their customers through electronic apps, social media,
or through E-commerce websites.</p>
</div>
<div id="types-of-studies" class="section level3">
<h3>Types of studies</h3>
<p>Most studies are concerned with the relationship between two
variables or more variables. Typically, we observe how the distribution
of a <i>response variable</i> (sometimes called a <i>dependent
variable</i>) changes in relationship to some <i>explanatory
variable</i> (also called the <i>independent variable</i>).</p>
<p>Typically, the question of interest is if/how does the distribution
of the <strong>response variable</strong> change in accordance to
changes in the <strong>explanatory</strong> variable.</p>
<p>There are two primary study designs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Observational studies</strong> - observe members of a
population and measure variables of interest on those members but do not
attempt to influence the responses.</p>
<ul>
<li>An observation study is a <i>uncontrolled</i> study to investigate
the relationship between a response and explanatory variable</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Experimental studies</strong> - deliberately impose
changes on an explanatory variable (called treatments) and we observe
how the response variable reacts to those changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>An experimental study is a <i>controlled</i> study to investigate
the relationship between a response and explanatory variable</li>

<div id="causation-vs-association" class="section level3">
<h3>Causation vs Association</h3>
<p>Both observational and experimental studies seek to quantify the
relationship between the response and explanatory variables. If two
variables are statistically related we say they share a statistical
<i>association</i>. If two variables are causally related, then changes
in the explanatory variable <i>cause</i> measurable changes in the
response variable. It is important to note that an association between
two variables <u> does not imply </u> that they have a cause and effect
relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Experimental studies control the assignment of observations to
the explanatory variable(s) through <i> randomization </i>. This means
experimental studies control for factors that may influence a
statistical relationship between two variables and provide good evidence
for causal effects.</p></li>
<li><p>Observational studies alone <i> cannot </i> definitively
establish a causal relationship between two variables. This is because
observational studies are prone to <strong>lurking variable</strong> -
an unknown variable that the researchers did not account for in the
study and has an association with both the response and explanatory
variables. Lurking variables can create the illusion of a statistical
relationship when none exists</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Many studies have looked at the relationship between coffee
consumption as an indicator for coronary artery disease. Studies that
fail to adjust for other risk factors, like smoking, have often reported
a positive association between these two variables. Thus smoking acts as
a lurking variable, magnifying the relationship between drinking coffee
and coronary artery disease risk</p>

</div>
<div id="experimental-design" class="section level3">
<h3>Experimental Design</h3>
<p>A study is considered an experiment when we actually manipulate
explanatory variable in order to observe how it changes the outcomes of
the response variables. Lets start with some terminology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The individuals (observations) on which the experiment is done
are called <strong>experimental units</strong></p></li>
<li><p>When the experimental units are human, we often refer to them as
<strong>subjects</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A specific experimental condition applied to the experimental
units is called a <strong>treatment</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Explanatory variables are called <strong>factors</strong> and the
various conditions of the <strong>factors</strong> are called
<strong>factor levels</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: What are the effects of repeated exposure to an advertising
message? The answer may be influenced by both the length of the add and
the number of times it is seen. Consider an experiment which used
undergraduate college students as subjects. All subjects were exposed to
a 40 TV-show that included adds for a fast food chain. Subjects were
randomized to either a 30-second or 90-second commercial. The same
commercial was shown 1, 3 or 5 times randomly during the show. After
viewing the show and commercials, students were asked to self report on
a Likert scale how their craving level for the advertised food.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>what is the response variable?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the factors that are manipulated?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the factor levels?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both experimental studies and observational studies <i>use
randomization</i> to select a sample of individuals from the population
of interest. But, unlike observational studies, experiments control for
the effect of lurking variables <u>through a second randomization</u>
which allocates experimental units to the different levels of the
treatment. This randomization balances the effect of any lurking
variables so that the effects of the explanatory variable on the
response can me isolated.</p>
<ul>
<li>The design of an experiment is said to be <strong>biased</strong> if
it systematically favors certain outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the hallmarks of a good experiment include, having a control
group and blinding to reduce bias:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>Control group</strong> - is a group of subjects in the
experiment who do not receive the treatment. A control group is used to
control bias in an experiment because, by design, the only difference
between the two groups is the treatment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blinding</strong> is a way of designing an experiment to
ensure that subjects are unaware if they are in the treatment or control
group</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Double blinding</strong> - when both subjects and the
researchers are unaware of who is assigned to the treatment group and
who is assigned to the control group.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest type of experimental design is called a
<strong>completely randomized design</strong> this design looks at the
effects of a single treatment on a response variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Experimental units are randomly assigned to each level of the
treatment</p></li>
<li><p>Each unit has an equal probability of being assigned to each
treatment group</p></li>
<li><p>Example: Imagine a pharmaceutical company conducting a clinical
trial to evaluate the effectiveness of two different formulations of a
pain relief medication. In a completely randomized design:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Group 1: Participants are randomly assigned to receive
Formulation A of the pain relief medication.</p></li>
<li><p>Group 2: Participants are randomly assigned to receive
Formulation B of the pain relief medication.</p></li>
<li><p>The random assignment ensures that any individual differences
among participants are equally distributed between the two groups. Both
groups are then monitored for pain relief outcomes over the specified
trial period. This design allows researchers to attribute any observed
differences in pain relief between the two groups to the specific
formulations of the medication, minimizing the impact of potential
confounding variables.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multifactorial</strong> experiments look at the effects of
two or more treaments on a response simultaneously. There are many
different types of mulitfactorial designs. Two commonly used designs are
described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Randomized block</strong> - When subjects are not similar
enough, detecting differences among the treatment groups can be
difficult. We instead create groups called blocks. Blocks are organized
so that units inside a block are more similar. Each block sees all
treatments in random order</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: an agricultural study where researchers are examining the
yield of three different types of fertilizers (A, B, and C) across four
different fields (Blocks 1 to 4). To control for potential variability
in soil conditions, a randomized complete block design is employed. In
this example, each block represents a different field, and within each
block, every type of fertilizer is randomly assigned to different plots.
This design helps account for potential variations in soil quality
between fields. The randomization ensures that any uncontrolled factors
affecting a specific block are equally distributed among the different
fertilizer treatments, making it easier to attribute differences in
yield to the actual effect of the fertilizers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Matched pairs</strong> - a design which takes
measurements on each subject, usually once before the treatment and once
after the treatment producing a set of paired measurements</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: consider a study investigating the impact of a new tutoring
method on students’ math performance. In this matched pairs design, each
subject is paired with another based on their initial math proficiency.
This pairing is based on the initial math scores of the students. After
the tutoring interventions, the math performance of both students in
each pair is measured again. By comparing the changes in performance
within each pair, researchers can better assess whether the new tutoring
method had a significant impact on math proficiency while controlling
for initial differences in skill levels.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="surveys" class="section level3">
<h3>Surveys</h3>
<p>Surveys (called sample surveys in statistics) are a type of
<i>observational study</i> where we select a subset of units from a
population of such units for the purpose of making inferences about the
distribution of all units (i.e., the population distribution).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In statistics, a survey is really any information gathered from a
sample of subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>census</strong> is a type of survey which attempts to
gather information for all (or nearly all) subjects in a
population</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A survey consists of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>sampling frame</strong> which is a list of subjects in
the population from which the sample will be collected</p></li>
<li><p>And a <strong>sampling design</strong> which is the method that
will be used to select subjects from the sampling frame.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any sampling design we choose should ensure that the sample we
collect is representative of the <u>entire</u> population we are trying
to estimate. Some common sampling designs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Convenience sampling</strong> is a type of
<i>non-random</i> sampling that involves the sample being drawn from
that part of the population that is close to hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Volunteer sample</strong> – a type of <i>non-random</i>
sampling where participants self elect to be part of the study because
they volunteer when asked or respond to advertisement.</p>
<ul>
<li>the most common type of convenience sampling</li>
<li>often required when we don’t have a sampling frame for the
population</li>
<li>this is the type of sampling used for most medical experiments</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A sample is more likely to be representative of the population if we
let chance, rather than convenience, determine which subjects are
sampled. For this reason, we typically choose a sampling design that
uses randomization to determine which units are selected from the
sampling frame.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple random sampling</strong> (also just called random
sampling) a type of <i>random</i> sampling where each subject in the
sampling frame to has an <u>equal probability</u> of being selected for
the sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>Random sampling can be done <i> with replacement</i> or <i>without
replacement</i></p>
<p>When we sample <strong>with replacement</strong>, each time we sample
a subject from the population we put the subject back so that it can be
sampled again.</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, for a population of size <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> each subject will have a <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{N}\)</span> chance of being included in
the sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we sample <strong>without replacement</strong>, then each time
we sample a subject from the population we remove that subject from the
sampling frame so that it cannot be selected again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This means that first subject will have a <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{N}\)</span> chance of being selected, the
second a <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{N-1}\)</span>, the third a
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{N-2}\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(\cdots\)</span> and so on</p></li>
<li><p>Sampling without replacement is common in most surveys because
the sample size is usually small in comparison to the population size
(i.e <span class="math inline">\(n &lt;&lt; N\)</span>) and thus it is
approximately the same as sampling with replacement</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following are benefits of simple random sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mathematically simple to compute estimates such as <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Samples tend to be a good representation of the
population</p></li>
