## Simple probability

$\bf (1)$ A fair coin is thrown 3 times. What is the probability that <u>at least</u> one heads is observed? 

<span style="color: red;">
\[P(\text{At least one heads}) = 1-P(\text{No Heads})\]
The sample space of this event is 
\[\mathbb{S} = \begin{bmatrix} \text{No heads} = (H,H,H) \\ 
\text{1 Heads} = (H,T,T),(T,H,T),(T,T,H)  \\
\text{2 Heads} = (H,H,T),(H,T,H),(T,H,H) \\
\text{All Heads} = (H,H,H) \end{bmatrix} \]
The sample space consists of 8 possible outcomes and there is only one outcome with "No Heads".
\[ P(\text{At least one heads}) = 1-P(\text{No Heads}) = 1-\frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \]
</span>

$\bf (2)$ Suppose that in a class of 30 students, 8 students are in band, 15 students play a sport, and 5 students are both in band and play a sport. Let $A$ be the event that a student is in band and let $B$ be the event that a student plays a sport. Create a Venn diagram that models this situation. What is the probability that a student is in the band or plays a sport?

```{r, eval = T, echo=F, message=F, warning=F, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
setwd("C:/Users/Bruin/Documents/GitHub/UI_STAT251-03_Spring_2024/docs/misc/")
x1 = c(paste(rep('bs', 5), 1:5), paste(rep('b', 8), 1:8))
x2 = c(paste(rep('bs', 5), 1:5), paste(rep('s', 15),1:15))

# venn.diagram(x = list(x1, x2), category.names = c("Band", "Sports"),
#              filename = 'myvenn.png',
#              OUTPUT = T)

class = list(Band = c(1:8),
             Sport = c(1:5, 10:19))
ggvenn(
  class, 
  fill_color = c("#0073C2FF", "#EFC000FF", "#868686FF"),
  stroke_size = 0.5, set_name_size = 8,
  text_size = 6
  )

#knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Bruin/Documents/GitHub/UI_STAT251-03_Spring_2024/docs/misc/Venn_4set_pretty.png")
```


<span style="color: red;">Since these events are non-disjoint, we must use the formula for a union of two non-disjoint events:
\[P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)\]
\[= \frac{8}{30}+\frac{15}{30} - \frac{5}{30} =\frac{18}{30}\]</span>

$\bf (3)$ A standard deck of 52 cards contains four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades). Each suit contains 13 cards (9 numbered cards and 3 face cards, and an Ace). 

* Suppose a single card is drawn at random, what is the probability that it is a numbered?

<span style="color: red;">\[P(\text{Card is numbered}) = \frac{\text{Number of ways to get numbered card}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{9 \cdot 4}{52} \]</span>

* What is the probability that the selected card is the Ace of Spades (assume independence where necessary)? 

<span style="color: red;">Let $A$ be the event that a card drawn at random is an Ace and $B$ be the event that a card drawn at random is a Spades. We are interested in the $P(A\cap B)$ and we are told to assume independence. Therefore
\[P(A\cap B) = P(A)\cdot P(B) = \frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{52}\]</span>

$\bf (4)$ An urn contains 5 green balls, 7 red balls, and 4 yellow balls. Two balls are selected at random with replacement. What is the probability that first ball is yellow and the second ball is red?

<span style="color: red;">Since the balls are selected <u>with replacement</u> the two events are independent. Therefore, the intersection of the two events: $A$ first ball yellow and $B$ second ball is red is given by
\[P(A\cap B) = \frac{4}{16} \cdot \frac{7}{16}  = \frac{7}{64}\]</span>

$\bf (5)$ The probability that it rains $R$ on a given day in Moscow, Idaho is $P(R) = 0.1$. The probability that it is Windy $W$ is $P(W) = 0.2$, and the probability that it is cloudy $C$ is $P(C) = 0.7$. Assume that these three types of weather events are independent. What is the probability that a given day is both Rainy, Cloudy, and Windy?

<span style="color: red;">We are told the events are independent and we wish to find the interection of $R$, $W$ and $C$:
\[P(R\cap W\cap C) = (0.1)(0.2)(0.7) = 0.014 \]</span>

## Sampling Distributions, Means, and Variances

px = 0.25^2*summary(as.factor(rowMeans(x)))
avg = sum(unq.means*px)
sigma.sq = sum((unq.means-avg)^2*px)
sigma = sqrt(sigma.sq)
```

* Compute the population mean $\mu$ and population standard deviation $\sigma$ of $X$

<span style="color: red;">\[\mu =\sum_x xP(x) \]
\[= 1(0.0625)+2(0.125)+\cdots +3.5(0.125)+4(0.0625)\]
\[= 2.5 \]</span>

<span style="color: red;">\[\sigma =\sqrt{\sum_x (x-\mu)^2P(x)} \]
\[= \sqrt{(1-2.5)^2(0.0625)+(2-2.5)^2(0.125)+\cdots +(3.5-2.5)^2(0.125)+(4-2.5)^2(0.0625)} \]
\[= \sqrt{0.625} \]
\[= 0.791\]</span>

$\bf (7)$ A random variable $Y$ has two possible outcomes. The outcome $Y = 1$ occurs with probability $p = 0.23$. Derive the sampling distribution for the proportion of outcomes with $Y = 1$ in a sample of $n = 3$ observations of $Y$.

<span style="color: red;">The population distribution of $Y$ is given by:</span>
```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
df = cbind(`$Y$` = c(0,1), `$P(Y)$` = c(0.77, 0.23))

  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")%>%kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 'striped')
```

<span style="color: red;">The sample space for the sample proportion of 3 observations of $Y$ is given below.</span>

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
gr = expand.grid(`Observation 1`=c(0,1), `Observation 2`=c(0,1), `Observation 3`=c(0,1))
df = cbind.data.frame(gr, `$\\hat{p}$`=rowMeans(gr)) 

kable(df, format = 'html', digits = 2, row.names = F, booktabs = T, escape = F)%>%

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}

  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")%>%kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 'striped')
```


$\bf (8)$ Consider a survey of tree volume. Suppose that in the population of trees $10\%$ have a volume of 10 cubic feet, $20\%$ have a volume of 20 cubic feet, $30\%$ have a volume of 30 cubic feet, and $40\%$ have a volume of 40 cubic feet. Let $X$ denote the volume of a randomly selected tree, assuming that every tree has an equal chance of being selected. The probability distribution of $X$ is given in the table below.


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F}

df = cbind.data.frame(X = c(10,20,30,40),
                      `P(X)` = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4))

  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")%>%kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 'striped')

```

* Confirm that $X$ has a mean of $\mu = 30$ cubic feet and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 10$ cubic
feet by computing them yourself.

<span style="color: red;">\[\mu = \sum_x xP(x)\]
\[ = 10(0.1)+20(0.2)+30(0.3)+40(0.4)\]
\[ = 30\]</span>


<span style="color: red;">\[\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_x (x-\mu)^2P(x)}\]
\[ = \sqrt{(10-30)^2(0.1)+(20-30)^2(0.2)+(30-30)^2(0.3)+(40-30)^2(0.4)}\]
\[ = \sqrt{100}\]
\[ = 10\]</span>

* Derive the sampling distribution for the mean tree volume in a sample of $n = 2$ trees.

<span style="color: red;">The sample space for the sample mean of 2 observations of tree volume is given below.</span>

## Deriving Probabilities From Discrete Distributions

$\bf (9)$ Michael Dickson, who plays for the Seattle Seahawks, is a punter in the NFL. The following sampling distribution gives the mean punting distance (in yards) for a sample of $n=4$ punts. Use this distribution to answer the following questions:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F}

df = cbind.data.frame(`$\\bar{X} =$ Mean Punt Distance` = c(35.33, 45.67, 55.00, 60.33, 65.67),
                      `$P(\\bar{X})$` = c(0.4, 0.5, 0.08, 0.01, 0.01))
kable(df, format = 'html', digits = 2, row.names = F, booktabs = T, escape = T)%>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")%>%kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 'striped')

```

* What is the probability the mean distance is 55 or more yards?

<span style="color: red;">\[ P(\bar{X} \geq 55) = 1- P(\bar{X} < 55)\]
\[ = 1-(0.4+0.5) = 0.1 \]</span>

* What is the probability the mean distance is at least 35.33 yards?

<span style="color: red;">\[ P(\bar{X} \geq 35.33) = 1\]</span>

* What is the probability the mean distance is between 35.33 and 45.67 yards?

<span style="color: red;">
\[P(35.33\leq \bar{X} \leq 45.67) = P(X = 35.33)+P(X = 45.67) = 0.9\]
</span>

* What is the probability the mean distance is 35.33 yards or 55 yards?

<span style="color: red;">Let $A$ be the event $\bar{X} = 35.33$ and $B$ be the event $\bar{X} = 55$, then
\[P(A\cup B) = P(X = 35.33)+P(X = 55) = 0.3+0.08 = 0.38 \]</span>




$\bf (10)$ A random variable $X$ follows a binomial distribution with with probability of success $p = 0.43$ and number of trials $n = 8$. What is the probability of observing fewer than 3 successes, that is what is $P(X < 3)$?

<span style="color: red;">Let $X \sim Binomial(p = 0.43, n = 8)$ then</span>

\[ \color{red}{P(X < 3) =  P(X = 0)+P(X = 1)+P(X = 2)}\]

\[ \color{red}{= \sum_{k = 0}^2 \frac{8!}{k!(8 - k)!} \times 0.43^{k} \times (1-0.43)^{8-k} \approx 0.256}\]





$\bf (11)$ Tom Brady is a famous quarterback who recently retired from playing in the National Football League. During his career, the probability that Brady would complete a pass in a given play was $64.3\%$.  If a typical NFL team runs about $35$ offensive pass plays, what is the probability that Brady would complete exactly $28$ pass plays in a game?

<span style="color: red;"> Let $X \sim Binomial(p = 0.643, n = 35)$ then

\[\color{red}{P(X = 28) = \frac{35!}{28!(35 - 28)!} \times 0.643^{28}\times (1-0.643)^{35-28} \approx 0.021}\] 

</span>


$\bf (12)$ A random variable $W$ follows a Poisson distribution with rate parameter $\lambda = 1.8$ events per hour. What is the probability of observing exactly four events in a given hour, that is what is $P(W = 4)$?

<span style="color: red;">Let $W\sim Poisson(\lambda = 1.8)$
\[P(W = 4) = \frac{1.8^4\cdot e^{-1.8}}{4!} \approx 0.072 \]</span>

<br>

$\bf (13)$ A factory experiences on average 3 equipment malfunctions per day, following a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter of 3. Calculate the probability that on a randomly selected day, the factory will <u>observe 3 or more</u> equipment malfunctions.

<span style="color: red;">let $X$ represent the number of equipment failures in a given day for the factor, then \[X\sim Poisson(\lambda = 3)\]
\[P(X\geq 3) = 1 - P(X< 3)\]
\[P(X < 3) =  P(X = 0)+P(X = 1)+P(X = 2)\]
\[= 1-\sum_{k=0}^2 \frac{1.8^k\cdot e^{-1.8}}{k!} \approx 0.577\]
</span>

## Deriving Probabilities From Continuous Distributions

${\bf (14)}$ Use the plot below of the probability distribution of a continuous random variable $X$ to answer the following questions

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=10}

  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,5*h1), 
                     breaks = seq(0, 5*h1, h1))+
  geom_segment(aes(xend = -1, x = 1, yend = 0, y = 0), size = 1, color = 'black')+

        axis.title = element_text(size = 14))+
  xlab('X')+

#dev.off()
```

Use the plot to find the following probabilities:

* What is $P(X<0.6)$?

<span style="color: red;">
In this plot the area comprising a single grid square is 
\[ \text{Area of a rectangle} = \text{Base}\times\text{Height} = 0.167\times 0.3 \approx 0.05\]
there are six grid squares between $0$ and $0.6$, therefore
\[P(X<0.6)= 6\times 0.05 = 0.3\]</span>

* What is $P(X>0.3)$?

<span style="color: red;">$P(X>0.3)= 1-P(X\leq 0.3) = 1-(2*0.05) = 0.9$</span>

* What is $P(1.5<X<1.8)$?

<span style="color: red;">$P(1.5<X<1.8)=0.05$</span>

Use the plot to find the following probabilities (recall that the area of a triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$)


* What is $P(Y>-0.25)$?

<span style="color: red;">In this plot the area comprising a single grid square is \[ \text{Area of a rectangle} = \text{Base}\times\text{Height} = 0.25\times 0.16 \approx 0.04\] There are $13$ grid squares in the area between $-0.25$ and $1.0$ $P(Y>-0.25)=13\times 0.04 = 0.52$</span>

* What is $P(-0.5<Y<0.25)$?

<span style="color: red;">There are $16$ grid squares in the area between $-0.5$ and $0.25$ therefore $P(-0.5<Y<0.25)=16\times 0.04 = 0.64$</span>

Use the plot to find the following probabilities (recall that the area of a triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$)


* What is $P(Z<2)$?

<span style="color: red;">$P(Z<2)=0.5(2)(0.3) = 0.3$</span>

* What is $P(2<Z<3)$?

<span style="color: red;">In this plot a single grid square has an area of $0.05$
thus the area between $Z = 2$ and $Z = 3$ is given by
$P(2<Z<3)=2(0.05)+(0.5)(1)(0.2) = 0.2$</span>

* What is $P(Z>4)$?

<span style="color: red;">$P(Z>4) = P(Z<2) =0.3$</span>

* Give the approximate value of the $25th$ percentile of distribution of $Z$

Using a $Z$-table, find the following (approximate) probabilities for $X$. You can also use the app in the course website or [StatDistributions.com](http://www.statdistributions.com/normal/) to check your result

* What is $P(X<15)$?

<span style="color: red;">\[ z = \frac{15-25}{4} = -2.5\]
\[ P(Z<-2.5) = 0.006\]</span>

* What is $P(X>28)$?

<span style="color: red;">\[ z = \frac{28-25}{4} = 0.75\]
\[ P(Z>0.75) = 1-P(Z\leq 0.75) = 1-0.773 = 0.227\]</span>

* What is $P(12<X<20)$?

<span style="color: red;">\[ z_{\text{lower}} = \frac{12-25}{4} = -3.25\]
\[ z_{\text{upper}} = \frac{20-25}{4} = -1.25\]
\[ P(-3.25 < Z < -1.25) =   P(Z<-1.25) - P(Z<-3.25) = 0.106 - 0.001 = 0.105\]</span>

* What is $P(X>30)$?

<span style="color: red;">\[ z = \frac{30-25}{4} = 1.25\]
\[ P(Z>1.25) = 1-P(Z\leq 1.25) = 1-0.894 = 0.106 \]</span>

* What is $P(25<X<33)$?

<span style="color: red;">\[ z_{\text{lower}} = \frac{25-25}{4} = 0\]
\[ z_{\text{upper}} = \frac{33-25}{4} = 2\]
\[ P(0<Z<2) = P(Z<2) - P(Z<0) = 0.977 - 0.5 = 0.477\]</span>

* What is What value of $X$ marks the $95th$ percentile of the distribution?

<span style="color: red;">the $95th$ percentile of a standard normal distribution is $z=1.645$ plugging this into the $z$-score equation and solving for $X$ gives
\[ (z\times \sigma) + \mu = (1.645\times 4) + 25 = 31.58 \]</span>

* What is What value of $X$ marks the $40th$ percentile of the distribution?

<span style="color: red;">the $40th$ percentile of a standard normal distribution is $z=-0.253$ 
\[  (z\times \sigma) + \mu = (-0.253\times 4)+25 = 23.9 \]</span>


${\bf 18.)}$ Suppose that a random variable $X$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu = -5$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 1.8$. Using the plot of a the $Z$-distribution below, shade in the area corresponding to the probability $P(-2< X <0.5)$


<span style="color: red;">start by finding the $z$-scores\[ P(-2<X<0.5) = P(X<0.5) - P(X<-2)  \]
\[ z_{\text{lower}} = \frac{0.5 - (-5)}{1.8} = 3.06\]
\[ z_{\text{upper}} = \frac{-2 - (-5)}{1.8} = 1.67\]
\[P(-2<X<0.5) = P(1.67< Z < 3.06)  \]</span>
